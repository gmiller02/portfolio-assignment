    <p>
        For an assignment in my UI/UX design class, I was tasked to redesign a poorly designed website.
        During this project, I completed an entire design process to practice every stage in the 
        journey. </p>
    <p>
        I was given three weeks to complete this assigment, and each week was divided into a checkpoint. I completed a 
        series of lo-fi wireframes the first week, hi-fi wireframes and a style guide during the second week, and
        completed the website redesign at the end of the third week. 
    </p>

    <h2>Identifying Usability Problems</h2>

    <h3>Website and page: </h3>

        <p>
            I chose to redesign <a href="https://www.marxists.org/english.htm">marxists.org</a> because when I polled several close friends of mine about 
            terrible interfaces they have used in the past, two of them named this particular website independently. 
            Both of these friends are history majors, as am I, and I have a particular interest in making 
            sure public archives are accessible to the public. 
        </p>

    
    <h3>Finding Problems:</h3>
        <p>
            There are several notable issues with the original website. The text itself is incredibly low-resolution. 
            The page does not fill the entire screen lengthwise and if the computer screen is not fully extended to the bottom, you do not see the select 
        boxes. The select boxes visually clash with the rest of the screen. The text colors do not coordinate 
        with the page and seem chosen just because they are bright. The background images are incredibly hard to 
        make out and therefore seem unnecessary, and there is no comprehensible visual hierarchy.   
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, the website was not designed with acessibility in mind. Few images have alt text, there is no heading structure or page regions, and the layout 
            table at the bottom is not visible or particularly striking. Additionally, the links to the 
            particular scholarsâ€™ archives have no text and are not visually clickable. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In short, it looks terrible and is difficult to use. With these issues in mind, I began the design process. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
            I completed eight speed-sketches to test out potential ideas for the interface:
        </p>
        
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="8_sketches.png" alt="8 speed sketches">
            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
    
        <p>
            Then, I combined elements from the sketches into a final sketch:
        </p>
        
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="final_sketch.png" alt="final sketch">
            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        
    
        <h2>Lo-Fi Mockups</h2>
        <p>
            Based on the final sketch, I sketched some lo-fi mockups, which incorporated the design
            of the sketch and the design problems I identified earlier. 
        </p>
        
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="lo_fi.png" alt="lo fi mockup">
            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        
    
        <h2>Style Guide</h2>
        <p>
            My style guide went through two iterations: originally, I had some red elements on the black background,
            but after conducting some research on accessible color pallates I saw that in keeping the red on black
            color scheme of the original page, I was not improving on the visibility of the original website. I thus
            decided to make a more visually striking style guide based on black, white, and shades of grey in order
            to match the greyscale images retained from the original design. 
        </p>
        
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="style_guide.png" alt="style guide">
            <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
    
    <h2>High-Fi Mockups:</h2>
    
        <p>
            Below are my high-fidelity mockups. Although I only coded the monitor version of the website, I designed a 
            phone and tablet version of the site. I adjusted the individual archive icons so that they are still visible. 
        </p>

        <h3>Takeaways: </h3>


    <p>
        The aim of this project was to redesign a webpage in order to develop design skills, 
        identify accessibility issues, and gain coding experience as it relates to web-app interfaces. I learned how to effectively
        articulate the differences between effective and ineffective design, break down why I made certian design choices, and practice
        certian basic elements of the design timeline such as mockups, style guides, and ensureing that the designs are responsive.
