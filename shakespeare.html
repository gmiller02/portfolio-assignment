    <h3>Comparative Analysis:</h3>

  <p> Along with a good portion of the internet, I have recently started logging my recent media consumption, including movies on 
    letterboxd and books on Goodreads, which I have found fun and enriching. As part of a project for my UI/UX design class, I was 
    tasked to create a sorting aggretator website, and I decided to create a Goodreads-style reading tracker for Shakespeare plays
    and poems, which are a passion of mine as a reader and actor. My goal was to refine my React skills while examining what types of 
    design are appealing to an audience that is perhaps more humanities rather than STEM-oriented. 
 </p>  

 <p>
    I was given three weeks to complete this assignment, and spent the entierity of the first one researching the design of
    Goodreads and other reading tracker applications to gain a better sense of what my design was to resemble.
 </p>

<p>
    As I conducted research, I discovered that Goodreads was far from the only reading tracker 
    application out there. I found a plethora of blog articles and reddit snark pages that complained about Goodreads' user
    interface, calling it clunky and outdated. I examined two competitor websites, Storygraph and LibraryThing. 
</p>

</figure>

<p>
    In summary, I enjoyed the style and simplistic nature of the Storygraph profile tagging system, but found that 
    Goodreads and LibraryThing's "outdated" horizontal profile layout and warmer color scheme easier to navigate. I did not
    feel like Storygraph had found a way to make their web app scrolling interface intuitive for use on a monitor. 
</p> 

<h3>Design Process:</h3>


<p>
    I spent the remaining two weeks of my project planning what I wanted my website to resemble based on my comparative analysis. 
</p>

<p>
    I thought that 
    the warm color palettes of Goodreads and LibraryThing were preferable to the dark color scheme of Storygraph, as they 
    recalled the pages of books and the wood of libraries. I also wanted to display as much of the functionality of the website as possible,
     so I decided to display all of the sort and filtering buttons at the top of the website. 
</p>

<p>
    Additionally,
    the rules of the assignment dictated that I practice my React skills by building two sort categories and an aggregator. I made the aggregator
    a 'favorites' category. This category was inspired by the reading tracker websites I researched, which all had an 
    automatically generated category of 'favorites' that you could sort certian books under. 
</p>

<figure class="image-container">
    <img src="favorites.png" alt="favoriting system">
    <figcaption>Favorite plays and poems display in the "Favorites" section</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    I  wanted to make sure the aggregator was
    visible as soon as one loaded the website, so the user could see its purpose immediately. I also wanted the favoriting function to look
    visually distinct, so I implemented a logo so that the user can ‘heart’ certain items, which was inspired by Spotify. If I continued to build this website out, the ‘favorites’ 
    would be an automatically generated category like it is currently, and the user would have to create the other aggregators themselves. That would 
    comprise the tagging system.
</p>

<figure class="image-container">
    <img src="example_card.png" alt="example card" class="smaller-image">
    <figcaption>Play information card</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    I decided to sort the plays by the year they debuted 
in ascending order, and filter them in two categories: filtering them by separating them into plays and poems, and then filtering the specific plays by genre:
comedy, tragedy, and history. 
</p>

<figure class="image-container">
    <img src="buttons.png" alt="example card" >
    <figcaption>Menu</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    I wanted to make as many items on the website displayable without the user needing to scroll. However, Shakespeare wrote a great number of plays
    and poems, and unfortunatly they cannot all be displayed at once without the font being smaller, which would impact accessibility. Additionally, the simplistic look
of the buttons is also intentional. I enjoyed the older feel of the buttons and menus on goodreads and LibraryThing. I made the text and buttons larger as to not impact accessibility,
but otherwise I wanted to focus on the simplistic and nostalgic design as well.
</p>

<h3>Takeaways: </h3>

<p> The following project encouraged me to develop two sets of skills: the first, 
    practicing comparative analysis by comparing the design of competitor websites. 
    The second, creating functional aggregators using React in order to develop and 
    practice frontend development.
    I also highly enjoyed creating this website as it was a way for me to combine computer science with my extracurricular, non-STEM interests!
