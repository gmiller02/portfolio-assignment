    <h3>Background: </h3>
    <p>
        I'm not ashamed to admit that one of my hobbies is throwing parties. What's better than gathering 
        all of the people you love and appreciate in your life and making them do silly activities? That's why
        I was incredibly excited when offered the opportunity to complete an iterative design process for the 
        Partiful app. 
    </p>

    <p>This project was assigned to me as part of a UI/UX class. The students formed groups and were then matched
        with startup founders, who each assigned them a design issue or challenge. The groups created a series of flows
    in Figma that attempted to solve these issues. The groups had about three weeks to chat with the founders,
create lo-fi mockups, meet with the founders again to recieve feedback, and then turn in hi-fi mockups for approval and more
feedbback. </p>

    <p>
        Our group was assinged to the startup Partiful. Partiful is an app designed to make party invitations: think Facebook events but much more fun. As a 
        user, you create a profile on the app, and when you and another person RSVP to the same event, you can see
        the guest list by checking out other user's profiles. The app is whimisically designed and incredibly fun to use. 
    </p>

    <h3>A Very Gen-Z Problem:</h3>

    <p>
        However, the Partiful founders had a problem. The majority
        of their user base, especially the Gen-Z demographic as opposed to the millenial users, were not filling out their 
        profiles. Many profiles just used a first name and did not take advantage of the opportunity the app gave them
        to fill in their social media, birth month, and profile photos. Thus, the users of the app were largely unidentifiable.

    </figure>

    <p>
        My team was tasked with fixing this problem. How could we get a tech-savvy generation to give up their precious 
        information? How could we make a profile so enticing that people longed to fill it out? We were told our designs
        must include a sense of "partifulness", or bombastic, over-the-top styling, which was a fun challenge in our very
        minimalist day and age. 
    </p>

    <h3>Research:</h3>

    <p>
        To begin, one of our team members conducted some informal user testing and asked every single Partiful user
        she knew at our school several questions about Partiful's profiles. We found results similar to what the founders had told us:
        nobody had filled out their profiles or had any intention of doing so. There seemed to be a negative feedback loop
        where new users joined, saw empty profiles, and had no motivation to complete them themselves. Armed with this 
        information, my team set out to find them motivation. 
    </p>

    <h3>A Very Gen-Z Solution:</h3>

    <figure class="image-container">
        <img src="cooler profiles.png" alt="cooler profiles">
        <figcaption>Profiles with new features, designed by our team</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
        After a series of brainstorming sessions, my team came up with several ideas. We decided (and later user tested) that displaying
        a user's birth month on their profile was much less interesting than their zodiac sign, so we swapped them. We also created a new 
        feature called "party anthem", which allows users to link a song or playlist in their profile, and added a "first name" and "last name"
        section when editing the profile (rather than one section titled "name") so that users would be encouraged to input their full name. However,
        we still faced the same problem. Even if the profiles were full of more "partifulness", what would make the users interact with them?
    </p>

    <p>
        We created a brief video displaying these ideas and sent them to the founders, who enjoyed our concepts but expressed some concerns
        with fitting the Spotify interface into the app, as it is notoriously difficult to integrate. 
    </p>

    <h3>My Contributions:</h3>

    <p>
        I was responsible for coming up with one of the solutions to this problem, and thus I took the lead on this solution's flow. One of the features
        I loved about Partiful was the ability to customize the party invitations with beautiful backgrounds and fun animations. I had an idea: what if the 
        Partiful user profiles offered this same customization, but it could only be unlocked after you filled in all of your profile's information? That would
        give users a tangible and fun reward for completing the profile. I designed the following flow, shown below:

    </figure>

    <h3>Takeaways:</h3>

    <p>At our final meeting with the founders, we presented our flows. It was gratifying to hear that the founders 
        enjoyed our ideas, and that we had come up with similar concepts (such as having a component for 'upcoming events')
        independently of each other. We had a fascinating conversation about privacy, and how much information about each other
        we are entitled to on the internet. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I was incredibly grateful for all of the skills I gained throughout this project. It was the first time I had designed an interface
        as part of a team, and I learned how to co-design and co-build as a team. It was incredible to be able to develop a solution to a design 
        problem with an actual startup founder, and practice turning a problem statement into a usable prototype. However, the most important skill I 
        took away from this project was the ability to recieve and integrate feedback into my designs, both from the founders 
        and my teammates.
